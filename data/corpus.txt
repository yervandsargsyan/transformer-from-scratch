Our Pilgrim band of stern and rock-bound forefathers left us a goodly
heritage in New England. And, even though we may not still in awed tones
call it holy ground, yet the soil where first they trod calls forth a
certain respect and admiration not compelled by any other group of these
United States.

To be sure they didn’t tread all of it. Lots and lots of square miles of
ground and lofty soil are still untrodden to any great extent, especially
the northern parts of the northern states.

Maine, with its great, beautiful Aroostook County, whose far-flung potato
farms have a charm all their own, and whose glistening white farm-houses
have their barns hitched on behind like majestic trains of cars—the
exquisite tidiness of Maine as a state far outranks all her twelve
original sisters.

In New Hampshire the white paint is less immaculate, the state less
tidily cleared up, but the woods against a stormy sky their giant
branches toss, and the rocking pines of the forest roar their eternal
welcome. Timid little lakes nestle confidingly among the hills and the
White Mountains cluster in majestic serenity.

And then comes Vermont, beautiful, careless Vermont, forgetful of her
white paint, heedless of her broken-down fences, conscious only of her
green Green Mountains and the sounding aisles of her dim woods.

East of the Green Mountain Range, in northern Vermont, is wide, rolling
country, with here and there a handful of small hills dumped down as
though they had been flung at the Range and fell short of their mark.
Among them are valleys and lakes, vistas and scenery, verdure and
foliage,—all that goes to make Vermont what her beautiful name means.

And villages. These are not always as picturesque as they should be, but
man’s place in nature is frequently out of harmony with his surroundings.

What should be a quaint little hamlet with an old white-spired church and
a few clustering cottages, is more often a Four Corners or a few rods
or perches of a stupid-looking Main Street, totally lacking in pride,
prosperity, or paint.

Farm-houses are shabby and fences dilapidated, yet, after all, there are
sites and spots—oh, the sites and spots of Vermont!

If one wanted to build ten thousand homes, he could find a satisfying
site or spot for each and have as many left over.

In our forefathers’ days, the soil where first they trod was considered
the very thing for highroads, but now the broad white ribbon of concrete
that tangles itself among the green hills is exceedingly convenient,
without marring the picture.

And the towns that chance to impinge on or straddle that road are up to
date and almost a part of the living, bustling world outside.

But the towns reached by the lesser roads, the older roads,—they have no
animal spirits and lead a mere vegetable life.

Unless a great country house has been built on a site or a spot near-by,
these little villages have none at all to praise and very few to love.

Hilldale was one of the prettiest of these villages and was in fairly
good repair. This was owing to the fact that it had offered an
unsurpassed site for a gentleman’s country house.

The gentleman had materialized, and so, later, did the house.

It had happened forty years ago. Vicissitudes had removed the gentleman
but the house remained—remained empty for years, and at last, five years
ago, had been bought, furnished, and occupied.

Yet the fact of the house, half a mile from the village street, so
influenced and stimulated the villagers that unconsciously they lived
up to it and gloried in its possession as in an invisible jewel held in
trust.

For the house was invisible, by reason of those same dim woods and
rocking pines, and moreover, because of high and strong stone walls.

Yet it was there and it was theirs, so Hilldale plumed itself and went
about its business.

Off the main travelled road of traffic, it was also off the main line of
the railroad and was reached by a tiny spur, whose trains, not impressed
by the great house, ran with a debonair disregard of timetables or
schedules.

And so, when one of these trains pulled up with a grinding jerk, and the
leisurely, easy-going conductor sang out, “Hilldale!” John Haydock, who
had risen, almost fell over backward by reason of the sudden stop.

The train was nearly an hour late, and though still well up in the
heavens, the November sun was secretly preparing for a quick swoop down
and out. The air was damp and raw, with a feeling that portended snow.

Beautiful Vermont had lost her green, but was bravely substituting a
glory of red and russet and gold that clad her hills and dales with a
blaze of autumn beauty.

John Haydock shivered as he stepped to the station platform, then drew up
his overcoat collar, and appreciatively lapped up the beauty of the scene
even while he looked about at conditions.

He saw a phlegmatic looking man standing near an elderly Ford, and with
admirable sagacity deduced a local taxi driver.

“I want to go to Homer Vincent’s,” Haydock said, half expecting the man
would drawl out “Wal, why don’t ye, then?” after the approved manner of
Vermont natives in fiction.

But the influence of the house wouldn’t allow that, and the man merely
gave a sort of grunt that seemed to mean “All right,” or “Certainly.”

Moreover, he showed a gleam of curiosity in his hard, weather-beaten blue
eyes, and moved with alacrity as he took the stranger’s bag.

But he said nothing as he held the car door open for his passenger, and
then took his own place at the wheel.

“Is it far from the village?” Haydock asked.

The driver rolled a blue eye around at him.

“Ain’t never been there, eh?” he said. “Well, it’s about halfa mile,—good
halfa mile. I ain’t never been in the house myself. Druv up to the
entrance now, naginn,—just now, naginn. Great place!”

He spoke in an awe-struck voice, as one might of some masterpiece of God
or man, and Haydock said, involuntarily:

“Is it such a beautiful house?”

“Is it? _Is it!_ Well, you’ll soon see!”

They had left the village now, and were passing along a wooded country
road, beautiful with its pines and hemlocks among the bright autumn
leaves. A few roads branched to right or left, but the Ford car clattered
straight ahead.

“Mr. Vincent get over his broken leg?” Haydock asked. “Can he walk all
right?”

“Yep, mostly. Has a little limp—you’d hardly notice it, though. Course
we don’t see him hardly ever.”

“Recluse?”

“Not quite that,—but sticks to his home mostly. Miss Vincent, now, she’s
more sociably inclined.”

“Miss Rosemary?”

“Well, no, I didn’t mean her,—I meant the old lady,—Mr. Vincent’s sister.
Miss Rosemary, now, she’s here, there, and everywhere. Ridin’ a horse,
drivin’ a car, walkin’, skatin’ and they do say they’re goin’ to keep an
airoplane.”

“Really? How up to date they are.”

“Well, they are, an’ they ain’t. Yes, sir, they are, ’n’ they ain’t. The
old man, now—”

“Why do you call Mr. Homer Vincent an old man?”

“Thasso. He can’t be mor’n fifty,—’n’ yet, he somehow seems old.”

“To look at?”

“Well, no; though ’s I said, I don’t often see him. But if he’s passin’
in his motor-car, he don’t look out an’ nod at people,—see, an’ he don’t
seem to be smilin’—”

“Grumpy?”

“Not so much that as—”

“Indifferent? Preoccupied?”

“That’s more like it. Thinkin’ ’bout his own affairs, seemin’ly. An’ they
do say he does himself mighty well. And why shouldn’t he,—seein’s he has
plenty of money. Why shouldn’t he, I say?”

“Is he married?”

The driver turned fully around, leaving the temperamental Ford to its own
sweet will for a moment.

“Homer Vincent married!” he exclaimed. “I should say _not_! Him married!”

“What’s so strange about that? Lots of men marry.”

“So they do. Oh, well,—no, Mr. Vincent, he ain’t married.”

“What does he do? Any business?”

“Land, no; he’s got more money’n he knows what to do with. He just enjoys
himself, one way ’n’ another,—just one way ’n’ another. Miss Vincent,
now, Miss Anne, she rides about, stylish like, an’ makes fashionable
calls on the minister an’ a few families of the town. They been here five
years now, an’ yet mighty few people knows ’em atall.”

“He didn’t build his fine house?”

“Land, no. It was built long ago, by a man named Lamont,—long about
eighteen-eighty it was begun. Took years to build it, o’ course.”

“Is it so elaborate, then?”

“Is it? Look, here’s the beginnin’ of the stone wall now. See?”

“Good heavens, what a wall!” and Haydock stared at the high, massive,
tessellated structure of carefully hewn and laid blue dolomite, that
seemed to extend interminably.

“Yep, that’s it,” and the speaker wagged his head in deep pride of
ownership. For Hilldale felt that it owned the place individually as well
as collectively; and this in utter disregard of any opinion Mr. Vincent
might hold on the matter.

“He’s an inventor, you know,” Haydock was further informed, as they
neared the gates. “But I don’t think he invents anything.”

The great iron gates stood open but gave access only to a long avenue
shaded by almost perfect specimens of the beautiful “wine-glass” elm.

“That kinda ellum tree’s just about gone now,”—said Haydock’s guide.
“Mighty few left in all New England. Fine ones, these. Now, here begins
the poplar row. See ’m,—not Lombardy,—they’re North Carolina poplars.
I guess Mr. Vincent set these out. They ain’t long-lived. Well, here
we come to the wooded drive. The rest of the way to the house is right
through a jungle. I’d hate it.”

The jungle was a grove, rather sparse than thick, of pine, spruce,
hemlock, and larch, and its shadows were dank and black.

An occasional white birch, slender and ghostly, instead of lightening
the gloom, rather added to it, and the rays of the now setting sun could
scarcely penetrate the murk.

“Not very cheerful,” was Haydock’s comment.

“Now, here, sir, is the tree that gives the place its name.”

“What is its name?”

“Greatlarch,—that’s what they call it, Greatlarch,—’count o’ that big
tree there. See?”

Haydock looked and saw the tallest larch tree he had ever seen. It was
enormous, a most magnificent specimen. Surely the name was well chosen.

“That’s a hummer,” he agreed.

“Yep; nothin’ like in these parts,—an’ I don’t believe, nowhere.”

“I don’t either!” said Haydock, regardless of negatives in his enthusiasm.

“Now, you see, sir, we come to the entrance proper. This stone gateway’s
where I leave you. Want me to wait?”

“No,” and Haydock dropped his sociable manner and became again a
stranger. “What do I owe you?”

“One dollar, sir. Don’t want me to wait? You stayin’ here?”

Haydock looked at him.

“I’m not sure just what I shall do. Have you a telephone?”

“Yes, sir; call 87 Hilldale.”

“And your name?”

“Prout. Mr. Vincent knows me. Tell him you want Prout,—that is, if you do
want me. To take you back,—you know.”

“Yes, I gathered that was what you meant. Good day, Prout.”

The entrance was a massive arch with a tower on either side.

It seemed to include guard-rooms and connected with what was doubtless a
porter’s lodge.

Haydock stared at the heavy stone-work, the beautiful design, and the
hint of green velvety lawn through the arch.

He wished the daylight would linger, but it was even now almost gone. The
gathering dusk gave the scene an eerie aspect, the great larch whispered
as its long branches slowly tossed about, and the pines responded with a
murmur of their own.

Seeing no one, Haydock stepped through the deep, wide archway, and then
stood still, spellbound at what he saw.

A pile of gray stone, red-tiled roofs, tall chimneys, towers, turrets,
dormers,—a perfect example of a French chateau of the period of the
Renaissance.

Haydock knew enough of architecture to realize that he was gazing at
a masterpiece. He had no idea there was such a building in America.
Perfect in every detail, exquisitely set in the midst of rolling lawns,
well-placed shrubbery, and noble old trees, with half glimpses, in the
fading light, of terraces and gardens beyond.

Deeply impressed, he approached the entrance, a recessed portico on the
north side of the house.

Outer doors of massive oak stood open, and he entered a vestibule
wainscoted and paved with richly hued marble.

Wrapt in contemplation of the detail work, he pushed an electric bell,
and was still unheeding when the door opened and a butler faced him
inquiringly.

He felt a slight thrill of disappointment, for, without knowing it,
he had subconsciously looked for a lackey in gold lace or at least a
powdered and plushed footman.

But this man, beyond all question a butler, and a knowing one, gave
Haydock an appraising glance, and in a tone nicely poised between
deference and inquiry, said:

“You wish to see—” The voice trailed off to nothingness, but the barrier
form of the butler gave way no inch of vantage.

“Mr. Homer Vincent,” said Haydock, suddenly recovering his wits, and
speaking with a firm decision.

“By appointment?” But the severity of the butler’s manner perceptibly
decreased and he even stepped back from the threshold.

“No, not by appointment,” and John Haydock came under the portal and
into the beautiful entrance hall. Again he was nearly swept off his feet
by what he saw. Marble walls and floors, painted friezes, vistas of
rooms opening one from another—surely he was transported to some Arabian
Nights’ Dream.

And again he was recalled to equanimity by that calm, cool voice:

“What name shall I give Mr. Vincent?”

And after the merest instant of hesitation, Haydock said:

“Tell him Henry Johnson wishes to see him,—on business, private,
personal, and important.”

This speech was accompanied by a straight, sharp glance at the man, and
the visitor, half-turning, began to give himself up to contemplation of
his surroundings.

“Yes, sir. Will you step in the reception room, sir?”

The reception room, in a large circular tower, was at the right as one
entered the house, and to this Haydock went.

The butler disappeared, and Haydock studied the room.

It was of the period known as Perpendicular Gothic, and the side walls,
delicately paneled in old oak, reached to the richly ornamented and domed
ceiling.

The chimney-piece, which curved with the circular wall of the room,
was of the rare Italian marble known as Red of Vecchiano, and it was
Haydock’s study of this that was interrupted by the entrance of his host.

“You like it?” Homer Vincent said in a tone of slight amusement. “It is
the only bit of that stone ever brought to this country.”

Turning, Haydock saw a moderately tall man with moderately broad
shoulders. His hands were in his pockets, and the smile that had sounded
in his voice was perceptible on his strong, well-cut lips.

He stood erect, his head thrown a trifle back, as if sizing up the
situation.

“If you like, I’ll show you the whole house,” he offered. “It’s worth
seeing.”

And now, Haydock looked at him as if sizing him up. Seemingly he had
forgotten the house in his interest in its owner.

He saw a strong face, which, though now smiling with courtesy, yet looked
as if, on occasion, it could be hard, even severe.

This may have been imagination, for Homer Vincent’s whole manner and
attitude betokened only a friendly welcome.

But Haydock noted the firm curve of the chin, the straight line of
the lips, and the haughty, aristocratic effect of the Roman nose, and
concluded, off-hand, that Homer Vincent was a power.

The dark hair was thickly streaked with gray, and the deep-set gray
eyes were of a peculiar penetration. And yet, important though the man
doubtless was, he had an air of indolence, of impatience under annoyance,
that was unmistakable and impossible to ignore.

“Well,” he said, shortly, “well, Mr. Henry Johnson, what do you want to
see me about?”

With a cautionary glance out through the doorway, Haydock leaned toward
him and whispered two words in his ear.

Vincent permitted himself a slight raising of the eyebrows,—an unusual
concession to interest or surprise.

“You do right to be discreet,” he said; “let us go to my own private
room,—it is just across the hall.”

He led the guest across toward the circular room in the opposite turret,
corresponding with the reception room.

And this time Haydock couldn’t restrain his exclamations.

“Let the business wait a few moments,” said Vincent, almost gleefully. “I
admit I am proud of my home; let me show you a little of it.

“You see, it was built many years ago by one Lamont, an eccentric
millionaire. It is an exact copy of one of the finest of the French
chateaux. Moreover, it is built of the most magnificent marbles ever
perhaps collected under one roof. Just the walls of this hall show
French Griotte, Porte Venere, Verde Martin, and here you see American
Black,—from Glens Falls. The floor is Morial marble from Lake Champlain.

“Ahead of you, looking toward the back of the house, you see the Atrium,
copied faithfully from the Erectheum at Athens. We will not go there
now,—nor to the Organ wing, where I have one of the largest and finest
pipe organs in the world. We will go now into my own private room, and
you shall tell me all about this matter you speak of.”

They crossed the hall, Haydock scarce able to tear his eyes from the
cabinets, paintings, and rare pieces of furniture. The tall chimney-piece
of the hall, Vincent said, was of Bois de Orient marble from Africa.

“Why all these rare marbles?” Haydock cried.

“It was Lamont’s fad,” Vincent replied. “And I’m glad he did it, for it
saved my having to collect them. I bought the place complete, though
totally unfurnished. It has been my pleasure to collect suitable
furnishings and I have enjoyed the task.”

“I should say so!” and Haydock stared about the room they entered, which
was Vincent’s very own.

Circular in form, it was finished in rare woods with a mantel of Siena
marble and bronze, which showed figures of Hercules in statuary marble.
The furniture, while not over-ornate, was in keeping with the character
of the room. In the center was a great flat-topped desk, carved and
inlaid, and at this the two men sat down.

It was after an hour’s conversation that Vincent said: “I will send for
my sister,—we must consult with her.”

A bell brought the imperturbable, yet eagerly solicitous butler, whose
name, Haydock now learned, was Mellish.

“Go to Miss Anne,” Vincent directed; “ask her to join me here if she will
be so good. Tell her I have a caller here. And, by the way, Mr. Johnson,
will you not stay the night? Then we can talk at our leisure and, also, I
can show you over the house, which I feel sure will interest you.”

Haydock looked at his host questioningly, decided he meant his invitation
sincerely, and accepted.

“But I have no evening togs with me,” he demurred.

“No matter, we will be informal. I am myself not overly given to
conventions and my niece is dining out. Mellish, take Mr. Johnson’s bag
to the south guest room, and make him comfortable there.”

Mellish departed, and after informing Miss Vincent, went about his other
errands.

“Man here,” he announced a little later to his wife, who was also the
Vincents’ cook. “Nicish chap, but addle-pated. So took up with the house
he don’t know what he’s saying.”

“They’re often took like that,” returned Mrs. Mellish, placidly. “Where’s
he put?”

“In the south room.”

“H’m; master must set a pile by him.”

“I don’t know about that. I’m not sure they ever met before.”

“Too bad Miss Rosemary’s out,—she likes a stranger here now and then.”

“Oh, Miss Rosemary wouldn’t look at him. He’s not her sort,” said Mellish.




CHAPTER II

THE GUEST AT GREATLARCH


The organ hall at Greatlarch was a massive west wing, with transepts
looking north and south. The hall, as large as a small church, was
Corinthian in design, with side walls of antique oak, marvellously carved
and gilded, that had been brought from England in panels. High above the
antique oak cornice rose the vaulted, coffered ceiling and at the east
end was a balcony that might be reached from the second story. A rose
window in the third story also looked down into the beautiful room.

In the semicircular west end was the great organ, and at its keyboard sat
Homer Vincent, his capable hands caressing the keys with a gentle yet an
assured touch. He usually spent the hour before dinner at the organ, and
those who knew him could divine his mood from the music they heard.

Tonight his mood was variable, uncertain. He struck slow, close harmonies
in a desultory fashion, his fine head bowed a trifle as if in deep
thought. Then, suddenly, he would lift his head, and the organ would peal
forth a triumphant strain, like a song of victory. Or some crashing
chords would resound for a moment, to be followed by a silence or by a
return to the slow, meditative harmonies.

Sometimes he would play works of the masters and again he would drift
into improvisations of his own.

As the dinner hour drew near, Anne Vincent came from her room on a
mezzanine floor, and went directly to the gallery that overlooked the
organ room.

A slight little lady, a spinster of forty-seven, she had enough
pretensions to good looks to warrant her pride in dress. Her hair would
have been gray, but for discreet applications of a certain concoction.
It would have been straight, but for the modern invention known as a
permanent wave. And so, she presented to the world a beautifully coifed
head of dark-brown hair, whose frantic frizz was persuaded to lie in
regular, though somewhat intractable waves. Her eyes were gray, like her
brother’s, but more bright and piercing. Her air was alert, observant and
interested. Where Homer Vincent showed utter indifference to the universe
at large, his sister manifested interest, even curiosity, toward all
mundane matters.

Her slight figure was youthful, her manner animated, and her clothes were
in exquisite taste and bore the labels of the best modistes.

Tonight she wore a Georgette gown of a pale apricot color, simply made,
but with delicate, floating draperies that betokened the skilled hand of
an artist. Her only ornament was a large and perfect ruby, set in finely
wrought gold work.

With a light step she tripped down the short mezzanine stairs to the
upper front hall. This was no less beautiful than the hall below. It was
flanked on either side by four Corinthian columns with gilded capitals,
and the panelled ceiling was modelled after one in the Ducal Palace at
Venice.

Save for the Tower rooms on either side, this hall took up the entire
front of the house, and from it a balcony rested on the portico above the
main entrance.

Through the hall Miss Anne went, her high-heeled slippers making no sound
on the rugs, which were skins of polar bears.

Through to the balcony above the organ room she passed and stood, one
slim hand on the carved balustrade, looking down at her brother.

“Poor Homer,” she thought to herself; “he doesn’t know what to do. But of
course Mr. Johnson is right in the matter,—and of course he knows—my! it
means a lot of money! Well, Homer has plenty—if he will only think so. A
strange man, that Mr. Johnson—now I think I like him,—and then—I don’t—I
wish I—but, of course,—my heavens! here he comes now!”

Anne Vincent looked up with a smile as Haydock joined her on the balcony.

The man was still rolling his eyes about as if in a very ecstasy of
delight in what he saw.

This was his first glimpse of the organ, as after their talk Vincent had
sent him to his room to tidy up for dinner.

“I regret my informal attire—” he began, as he joined Miss Anne, but she
brushed aside his apology.

“It’s all right,” she said; “we’re always informal when we’re alone. Now
I should like elaborate dress every night, but my brother and my niece
wouldn’t hear to such a thing. So you’re quite all right, Mr. Johnson.
What do you think of the organ?”

“I have no adjectives left, Miss Vincent. The whole place stuns me, I
can scarcely believe I am in America,—I feel transported to the France of
the Renaissance.”

“You are familiar with the history of that period?” She looked at him
curiously.

“No,” he replied, honestly enough. “No, I am not. But I know this is all
of that era, and anyway, it so overwhelms me, I can’t quite analyze my
emotions.”

“Yes, I felt like that when we first came here. But five years have made
me feel at home in this atmosphere. Your room, Mr. Johnson, is just above
my own. It looks out on the south gardens and I am sure you noticed the
lagoon and the Greek Temple?”

“Of course I did, though the twilight view made me only more anxious to
see it all by daylight.”

“Which you can do in the morning. My niece will be here then, and she
will show you the grounds. That Greek Temple is a Mausoleum.”

“A wondrously beautiful one!”

“Yes, is it not? And now, dinner is served,—come Mr. Johnson,” and then,
“Come, Homer,” she called to her brother at the organ.

Vincent met them in the lower hall, and ushered them into the Atrium.
This, perhaps the most imposing feature of the house, was a pure and
perfect example of Greek Ionic architecture.

From the floor of native white marble, rose sixteen monolithic columns
with gilded capitals and bases of Bois de Orient and Vert Maurin marble.
The side walls were of Rose of Ivory marble quarried in the Atlas
mountains of North Africa.

These details Homer Vincent told his guest as they passed through the
great room, and drew his attention to the tall plate-glass windows that
formed the whole southern end.

Between the Ionic columns of the semicircular south portico could be seen
the lagoon with its fountain, and at its far end gleamed the pure white
of the Greek Temple against a dark setting of pines and larches.

Johnson sighed as they turned to the dining-room, another marvel of
Italian Renaissance, in antique English oak, with tall chimney-piece of
French Griotte and Belgium Black marbles.

“I wonder,” Haydock said, whimsically, as they took their seats, “if
the native marble of Vermont resents the presence of these imported
strangers.”

“I have thought that, too,” and Miss Anne’s eyes twinkled, “I am sure it
is the case.”

“They dislike one another,” Vincent said, taking up the jest. “The
Italian and African marbles scorn the Vermont stone, however pure
and white. But they are silent about it, for the most part. In our
living-room is a chimney-piece of Porte Venere or ‘Black and Gold’
marble from Spezia, which, with its gold bronze ornaments is one of the
handsomest and most expensive features of the house. You will forgive my
descanting on these things, Mr. Johnson, but I own up that this house is
my hobby, and I am a bit daft over it.”

“I don’t wonder,” declared Haydock, with honest enthusiasm. “And I am
glad to hear these details. Of course, I am especially interested,
because of—”

“I am going to ask of you,” Vincent interrupted him, “not to discuss
during dinner the business on which you came here. It is,” he smiled,
“bad for our digestion to think deeply while eating, and too, I want you
to do justice to the art of my cook.”

The dinner, indeed, as well as the service of it, was entirely in harmony
with the surroundings, and though there was no unnecessary pomp or
ceremony, the details were perfect and correct.

Mellish, like a guardian spirit, hovered about, and two waitresses under
his jurisdiction were sufficient to insure the comfort of the party.

“I am sorry your niece is not at home,” Haydock said, as Rosemary’s name
was casually mentioned.

“You shall see her tomorrow,” Vincent promised. “This evening we must
have another confab in my study as to our business, and I trust we shall
settle it to the satisfaction of all. Mr.—er—Johnson, you must remain
here for a time as our guest.”

“Thank you,” Haydock said, simply. “I trust I may do so.”

He looked at Miss Anne, as if expecting a confirmation of the invitation,
but she said nothing.

“I suppose,” he said, “that, having your sister and your niece, you have
not felt the need of a wife as chatelaine of this wonder-home.”

Homer Vincent smiled.

“I’m afraid,” he said, “no wife would put up with my vagaries. I’m not an
easy man to live with—”

“Oh, now, Homer,” his sister protested, “you sha’n’t malign yourself. If
my brother is a bit spoiled, Mr. Johnson, it is because my niece and I
pet and humor him. It is our pleasure to do so. You see, my brother is a
very remarkable man.”

“And my sister is blindly prejudiced in my favor,” Vincent tossed back.
“We are a very happy family, and perhaps the more so that each of us
follows his or her own sweet will.”

Although no outward change took place on the features of the
blank-countenanced Mellish, yet could one have seen into his brain, there
was indication of unseemly derision and unholy mirth.

For, as a matter of fact, every one at Greatlarch, whether family, guest,
or servant, followed the sweet will of Homer Vincent.

At least, he did if he knew what was good for himself.

Yet Vincent was no tyrant. He was merely a man whose only desire in life
was creature comfort; whose only pursuit was his own pleasure; whose only
ambition was to be let alone.

His sister and niece might do what they would, so long as they did not
interfere with his plans. His servants might have much liberty, many
indulgences, if they would but attend perfectly to his wants or needs.
Guests could have the freedom of the place, if they kept out of his way
when not wanted.

Homer Vincent was not so much selfish as he was
self-indulgent,—self-centered. He was scholarly and loved his books;
musical, and loved his organ; artistic and æsthetic, and loved his house
and his collections; he was of an inventive turn of mind, and loved to
potter about in his various workrooms and laboratories, without being
bothered as to what he was doing.

In return for these favors he gave his sister and niece pretty much a
free hand to do as they chose, checking them now and then in the matter
of expenditures. For though the Vincent fortune was large, it was not
inexhaustible, and the upkeep of the place was enormous. Yet it must be
kept up in a manner to please Homer Vincent’s ideas of comfort, even
though this necessitated curtailing the hospitalities toward which Miss
Anne and Rosemary inclined.

Homer was kindly by nature; he really disliked to deny Anne anything she
wanted, but, as he said, they couldn’t entertain all Hilldale all the
time, especially as they had no desire to accept return hospitalities.

And if Miss Anne did have such an undesirable desire, she kept it to
herself, for she adored her clever brother.

Her other brother, the father of Rosemary, had died five years before,
an event which resulted in the girl’s coming to live with these relatives.

The household was harmonious,—if and when the two women sank their own
wills in the will of Homer Vincent. Otherwise not.

Not that there was ever any friction, or unpleasantness.

Vincent had a way of attaining his end without such. And, perhaps through
habit, perhaps following the line of least resistance, both the older
woman and the girl willingly capitulated when conditions required it.

For Rosemary loved her Uncle Homer, and Miss Anne fairly worshipped him.

It went without saying, therefore, that Vincent’s hint that business
matters should not be discussed at the table, was effectual.

Haydock acquitted himself fairly well. The interest he felt in the
business which had brought him thither, and the absorbing entertainment
of this beautiful home, filled his mind to the exclusion of all else. And
since the first subject was for the moment taboo, he pursued the other
with zest.

“The man who built this was a genius,” he declared.

“It was built,” Vincent informed him, “by a prominent firm of New York
architects, but as they faithfully copied an old French chateau, they
had little need for originality. Of course it was a folly. These great
palaces often are. After getting it, the owner found he hadn’t sufficient
fortune left to keep it up. So it came into the market, and years later
I was fortunate enough to get it at a great bargain. Probably I paid not
half of the original building cost.”

“Lack of funds wasn’t the only reason that Mr. Lamont wanted to sell it,”
Miss Anne said, with a glance at her brother.

“No,” and Homer Vincent looked grave. “There is a tragedy connected with
the place, but I try not to let it affect my nerves or even linger in my
memory. I wish you would do the same, Anne.”

“Oh, it doesn’t get on my nerves, Homer, but I can’t put it out of my
memory, altogether. I am reminded of it too often.”

“May I hear the story?” asked Haydock, looking from one to the other.

“If you wish,” Vincent said, a little unwillingly; “but it’s not a
cheerful one.”

“Anything connected with this wonderful place must be of interest,”
Haydock declared, and Anne Vincent began the tale.

“It’s a ghost story,” she said, her eyes showing a sort of horrified
fascination. “You see, Mrs. Lamont, the wife of the former owner, was
murdered in her bed—”

“Now, Anne,” her brother interrupted, “we don’t know that she was—it may
have been a suicide.”

“No,” Miss Anne declared, positively, “she was murdered, and her ghost
still haunts the place.”

“Have you seen it?” Haydock asked. He had deep interest in the occult.

“I haven’t seen it,—but I’ve heard of it,” she replied, in a whisper.
“What do you suppose it does? It plays the harp—the Wild Harp!”

“Oh, come now, Anne, don’t bore Mr. Johnson with your fairy tales.”

Homer Vincent was in the best possible humor. He had had a dinner that
exactly suited him, perfectly served, and now as he pushed back his
chair a little, he was raising a cigar to his lips, knowing that at the
instant it reached them a lighted match, in Mellish’s careful hand,
would touch the other end of it. Knowing, too, that an ash-tray would
materialize on the exact spot of the tablecloth that he wished it, and
that, simultaneously, his coffee cup would be removed.

These things were necessary to Homer Vincent’s happiness, and his
thorough drilling of Mellish had made them immutable.

He had instructed the butler long ago to measure carefully with a
yardstick the exact distances between the four table candlesticks as well
as their distance from the edge of the table.

Yet Vincent was no “Miss Nancy,” no feminine or effeminate fusser in
woman’s domain. All details of housekeeping were left to Miss Anne, whom
he had also trained. But the most infinitesimal derelictions from exact
order and routine were noticed and reproved by Homer Vincent and rarely
indeed did the same error occur twice.

In fact, after his five years of occupancy, he had his home in perfect
running order, as he conceived perfection.

Banquets were never given, house guests were rare, callers infrequent,
because none of these things contributed to the comfort of Homer Vincent.
His tranquil days were occupied with his pleasant avocations indoors,
varied by motor trips, horseback rides, or country rambles.

His stables and garage boasted the finest horses and cars, and in
addition he was seriously contemplating an aeroplane. Indeed, he had
already ordered plans drawn for a hangar.

All of his belongings were at the service of his sister and niece at such
times as he did not himself require them. It was their duty to find out
when these times were.

But the two women had no trouble about this. Vincent was not
unreasonable, and both Miss Anne and Rosemary were astute enough to read
him pretty well.

He required Anne to be always present to preside at his table. To be
sure, he did the presiding himself, but he wished her at the head of the
board always. This precluded her accepting invitations which did not
include him or which he was not inclined to accept. However, the placid
lady was more than willing to defer to his preferences.

Rosemary was allowed more freedom in these matters and went to visit her
girl friends as often as she chose. Having them to visit her was another
matter, and only to be suggested with the greatest discretion and
careful choice of opportunity.

“Yes,” Miss Anne was saying, “and, do you know, Mr. Johnson, my room,—my
bedroom is the one she had, and the one that is said to be haunted by her
ghost!”

“Really, Miss Vincent? And are you not timid—?”

“Not a bit! You see, it is the loveliest room in the house,—except
brother’s, and I would be silly to refuse it because of a foolish
superstition.”

“Just below my room, you said, I think?”

“Yes, facing south,—looking out on the lagoon and fountain and on down to
that beautiful marble Temple—”

“That is a tomb!” finished Vincent. “Any other woman would be scared to
death to look out on that view, but I believe my sister enjoys it.”

“I surely do, Homer. Often I look out there on moonlight nights and
feel sorry for the poor lady. And—” her voice fell, “sometimes I hear
her—playing on her harp—”

“Oh, come now, Anne, you’ll get Mr. Johnson so wrought up he won’t dare
sleep in his own room, which of course has the same outlook!”

“I’m not superstitious,” Haydock averred. “In fact, I should like to hear
the ghostly harp—though I cannot say I’d welcome a spook visitor!”

“Let us look out in that direction,” said Vincent, rising. His idea of
Anne’s presiding was to have her ready to arise at his signal, not the
other way.

He led them back through the Atrium and on out to the great semicircular
portico that was the southern entrance.

“It’s chilly,” he said, as he opened a long plate-glass door. “Better
stay inside, Anne. Just a moment, Mr. Johnson, unless you think it too
cold?”

“No, I like it,” and Haydock stepped out into the crisp night air.

“Feels like snow,” said Vincent. “Now, of course, tomorrow you can see
this in the sunlight, but in this dim murk, with the shadows so deep and
black, it is a picturesque sight, is it not?”

“It’s wonderful!” Haydock exclaimed, looking across the black water of
the lagoon, where the dimly seen fountain did not obscure the faint gleam
of white marble that was the Mausoleum.

“You like to keep that thing there?” he asked, curiously.

“Why not?” and Vincent shrugged his shoulders. “Since it doesn’t worry
the ladies, and I have no fear of spooks, why should I have it removed?
It is exquisite, the Temple. The model, as you can scarcely see now, is
that of the Parthenon.”

“How did the story of the haunting come about?”

“Since it is supposed that the lady was murdered, it would be more
strange if such a story did not arise. It was long ago, you know. I’ve
been here five years, but before that the house stood empty for nearly
twenty years. In that time many legends found credence, and many ghostly
scenes were reported. Apparitions flitting round the tomb are the most
common reports, but strains of a wild harp also are vouched for. Indeed,
my sister thinks she has heard them.”

“Have you?”

Homer Vincent hesitated, and then said, “There have been times when I
thought I did. But of course it was imagination,—stimulated by the weird
aspect of the place. Look at that thicket back of the Temple. Even now,
you can seem to see moving shadows.”

“What is behind there?”

“It is a sort of undergrowth of low pines and birches, scrub oaks and
elms, a tangle,—almost a jungle, of vines and canebrakes—”

“Swampy?”

“Not quite that,—though mucky after a long rainy spell. I threaten now
and then to have it all cleared out and drained,—but I haven’t got at it
yet. It is more or less fenced off,—you can just see the low stones—”

“Yes, they look like gravestones.”

Vincent smiled. “They do. That adds to the spookiness. Do you know the
villagers, before I came here, called the place Spooky Hollow?”

“And a good name, too!” Haydock shivered. The atmosphere of gloom was
beginning to tell on his nerves. “Guess I’ll seek the bright lights! It’s
fairly creepy out here!”

Vincent turned toward the house, his slight limp showing itself a little
as he crossed the tiled terrace.

“It is all most wonderful,” Haydock summed up, as they re-entered, “but
it does not make me forget my mission here—”

“Let that wait, my dear sir, until we are by ourselves.”

For the ubiquitous Mellish was in silent waiting to open the door wider
for them, to close it, and to stand at attention for orders.

Haydock perceived the man was a bodyservant of his master rather than a
mere butler.

“And now,” Vincent said, “we will again seek my own private room, and
settle the business. After that, I trust we shall all sleep contented and
serene. Come, Anne, we want your advice and opinions.”

Miss Vincent joined them, and as they passed into Homer Vincent’s Tower
room, Mellish, looking a little regretful, returned to his domestic
duties.




CHAPTER III

ROSEMARY


“That man up there is a queer bird,” Mellish declared to his wife, as he
joined her in the kitchen.

“As how?” Mrs. Mellish inquired, with slight interest.

The main kitchen at Greatlarch was a spacious room with walls of pure
white marble. Spotless all its appointments and speckless Mrs. Mellish
had them kept.

Of a truth she dwelt in marble halls, and having plenty of vassals and
serfs at her side, she secured the immaculate tidiness in which her soul
delighted, and which, incidentally, Mr. Vincent exacted.

No oversight of Susan Mellish was necessary. Cook she was, but also she
was queen of her own domain and life below stairs went on with no more
friction or dissension than above. In the household, Homer Vincent’s
motto was: “Peace at Any Price,” and if an underling disturbed it, there
was a rapid substitution.

Nor was there any ripple in the smooth-flowing current of the family
life. Homer Vincent saw to that. Not that the man was domineering. On the
contrary, he was a loving and kind brother and uncle. His tastes were
simple, even though luxurious. He asked only smooth-running household
machinery and no interference in his own pursuits.

Anne Vincent was nominally housekeeper, and indeed she kept up a
careful oversight, but Susan Mellish was so thoughtful, so capable, so
meticulously watchful of details there was little or nothing for Miss
Anne to do.

The whole household worshipped the master, and he repaid them by liberal
wages and comfortable living.

The servants’ quarters included delightful sitting-rooms and dining-room,
and their sleeping-rooms were most pleasant and beautifully appointed.

A feature of the house was Homer Vincent’s own suite. Above his Tower
room on the first floor was his smoking-room on the second floor. Back
of this followed his bedroom and elaborate bath. Next, his library, with
large open terrace that in winter became a sun parlor.

These rooms, of rarest marbles and woods, with French panels of
paintings, mirrors, and rich brocades, were appointed in perfect
taste. No gimcrackery ornaments, but dignified furniture and a few fine
paintings and vases.

The library was a joy. Comfort and beauty of the highest degree were
combined with utilitarian bookracks and tables.

These rooms ran along the whole east side of the house, ending with the
library and terrace, which looked down toward the Temple as well as off
to the east.

They were directly above the lower Tower room, the dining-room and
breakfast-room and the family living-room. The other side was taken up
by the reception room, the great organ wing, and, back of that, the
drawing-room. Between the two sides were the wide entrance hall, and the
wonderful Atrium.

Above the Atrium, at the south end, was Miss Vincent’s room, on a
mezzanine floor, and above that, on a second mezzanine, was John
Haydock’s room.

The floor above held six large guest rooms and the servants’ bedrooms
were higher still. However, electric elevators did away with the
discomforts of stair climbing, and the many floors, cellars, and
sub-cellars were easy of access.

And the two Mellishes, with Miss Anne watchfully observing, held the
reins of government of this establishment, and so great was their
efficiency, so true their system and method, that a jar of any sort was
exceedingly rare, and, because of its rarity, was fully and promptly
forgiven by Homer Vincent.

“Yes, a queer bird,” Mellish repeated, shaking his head. “He’s that dark,
now.”

“Dark?”

“You heard me! Yes, I said dark. Dark complected, dark eyes, dark hair,
dark hands, and dark clothes.”

“Not dressed up?”

“No, but that isn’t it, he’s almost dark enough to be a Creolian.”

Mellish was a good butler, but made an occasional slip in his diction.
One can’t know everything.

“Yes, Susan, he’s not our sort, and I know it. He’s peculiar,—that’s what
he is,—peculiar.”

“So’s the master.”

“Ah, that’s different. The Vincent peculiarities are of the right sort.
This man, now,—well, Susan, he was so took up with the place, he could
scarce eat his dinner.”

“Small wonder. The place is a fair marvel to those who’ve not seen it.”

“It isn’t that. I’ve seen guests before, who were overwhellumed by it.
But this chap,—he, why he had an appraising glance for it,—yes, sir,
appraising,—that’s the word.”

“Mellish, you’re daft. Appraising, was he? Like he meant to buy it!”

Susan’s ironic scorn would have withered any one but her husband.

“Susan, you’re a witch. That’s it exactly. Not that he meant such a
thing, he’s a poor man, I’m thinking,—but that was the way he looked at
it.”

“Drop him, Mellish. You’ve no sense tonight. Are you dismissed?”

“Yes. Mr. Vincent said he’d not need me more. They’re shut in the Tower
room, Miss Anne and all. They’re talking business. I can’t make that
felly out.”

“Did he look sinister?”

“What a woman you are for the word, Susan! No, it wasn’t that,—he looked
more—er—determined,—yes, that’s what that man is,—determined.”

“Determination can’t move the master. I’m bound he’ll be a match for
anybody’s determination.”

“Oh, it isn’t a clash of wills—or that. But there’s a matter between them
of some sort,—and Miss Anne’s in it, too.”

“And you’re eaten alive with curiosity, that’s what you are, man! Now,
get about your business. And see to it the plumber is ordered in the
morning. There’s a trickle in the cold storage room sink,—it only needs
a washer,—and the hothouse hamper didn’t come today,—send Dickson to the
station for it at sunup—and be sure to speak to Carson about his flirting
with Francine—it won’t do.”

As she talked, Susan was busily engaged in mixing and kneading the
breakfast rolls. This was a duty that could be entrusted to no lesser
artist in baking, for Susan’s rolls were nothing short of perfection, but
it required all her care and attention to keep them so.

In upon this engrossed couple drifted Francine, the pert little French
maid, who, though Miss Anne’s exclusive property, also looked after
Rosemary now and then.

“That man!” she exclaimed, with a shrug of her slender shoulders, “_Mon
Dieu_, but he is the beast!”

“Where did you see him?” and Mellish whirled on her.

“There, there, now, old man, don’t lose any temper! Miss Anne rang for me
to get her a scarf. They’re all in the Tower room, and they’re talking
most—”

“Angrily?” demanded Susan, whose curiosity was more aroused than she
would admit to her husband.

“No, not so much that,—as,—oh,—la, la,—excitement,—all talking at
once,—argument—see?”

“What are they talking about?” This from Mellish,—who asked to know.

“That I can’t say. When I entered all converse stopped. But I could see
the—atmosphere, the attitudes,—and the dark man—oh, he is a terror! Such
a low voice—”

“Oh, you couldn’t hear him through the closed door!” and Mellish glared
at her.

“_Non, Monsieur!_ Are you not desolate that I could not?”

Pretty Francine was a saucy piece and dearly loved to ballyrag the
dignified butler. But both the Mellishes liked her, though they kept a
wary eye on her coquettish ways with certain servants of the other sex.

“Is he threatening them?” Susan asked.

“Not quite that—but—”

“But you know absolutely nothing at all of what is going on!” Mellish
spoke sharply. “You’re only pretending you do. Stop discussing your
betters and get about your work.”

“I’ve no work to do until Miss Anne wishes to retire. She will ring for
me.”

“Then go and read your book. Or get some sewing. But don’t you dare go
outside the door!” Thus Susan admonished her, knowing full well the
girl’s secret intention of slipping out for a few moments to join Carson,
the chauffeur, in a stolen interview.

So Francine dawdled about until the bell rang and then presented her
demure self at the door of the Tower room.

Apparently the matter, whatever it was, had been most amicably settled,
for the three were smiling and contented looking as Francine scanned
their faces.

John Haydock was a dark man,—not like a Creole at all, but merely
markedly a brunette. His otherwise unnoticeable face wore a look
of satisfaction, and as he stepped out into the hall, he had again
that expression that could, perhaps, be called appraising. Yet small
wonder, for his deep and enthusiastic interest in the house led him to
examine its various beauties and marvels, and few could do so without
involuntary thought of the great outlay involved.

“I will go with my sister to her room,” Vincent was saying, “and you must
amuse yourself a few moments. Then I will rejoin you for a good-night
cigar, and then we will ourselves retire early.”

As was his nightly custom, Homer Vincent escorted his sister to her room.
Francine followed, and paused at the door, with her usual discretion.

“Come on in, Francine,” Vincent decreed. “I’m not chatting with Miss Anne
tonight. Get to rest, dear, and try to forget this whole matter. As you
know, I’m only anxious to do what is wise and right. You shall cast the
final decision as to all details and tomorrow we will draw up contracts
and all that.”

“How good you are, Homer; and though it was a long confab I do not feel
so very tired. Fix my powder, dear, and go back to Mr. Johnson. He is
a—not quite our sort,—is he, Homer?”

“Not quite, dear,—but he is a good business man, I judge, and he seems
honest.”

Miss Vincent required a small dose of opiate each night, and fearing lest
she should mistake the quantity prescribed, or that Francine might be
careless, Homer Vincent himself each night measured out the portion for
her.

“There you are,” he said, as he carefully gauged the dose. “Give it to
her when she’s ready, Francine. Good night, Anne, dear.”

He left his sister in Francine’s capable hands and went down to rejoin
his guest. It was a mark of respect, if not of liking, that he took John
Haydock up to his own library for their smoke.

Though sybaritic in many ways, Vincent did not employ a valet. His
preference was to have Mellish arrange his bedroom and night things,
and then to retire by himself whenever it pleased him to do so. Like
his sister, he was a poor sleeper, and often prowled round the house,
upstairs and down, during many of the small hours.

On the soft rugs his footfalls disturbed nobody, or if they did, no
one was alarmed, so, in this, as in all other matters, Vincent pleased
himself.

On this night, when at last he was alone in his own bedroom he bethought
himself of some matters he wished to attend to, that necessitated his
going downstairs to his private room. He had not yet begun to undress,
and as he went down the stairs and through the hall, where a dim light
burned all night, he met the night watchman, Hoskins. This was by no
means an unusual occurrence, for Hoskins came on every night at midnight,
and made certain prescribed routes through the premises.

Vincent gave the man a pleasant nod and went on his way. Though this
Tower room was sacred to his use, it was by no means kept locked or
difficult of access. Indeed, the door usually stood open, though in
the room itself were two wall safes, concealed by decorative hangings
and also a secret panel which was so cleverly hidden as to be perhaps
impossible of discovery.

It is at this point that Rosemary comes into this story.

She comes in a motor-car, out of which she steps softly, as the car
reaches the wooded part of the driveway.

Unafraid, because she knows Hoskins is not far away, and because this is
by no means her first experience of the sort, she makes her way silently
toward the house.

She cannot be seen gliding through the shadows, and she takes good care
she shall not be heard.

Reaching the stone arch of the entrance, she slips through, and pauses
to reconnoitre. No lights are on save those in her uncle’s suite, and one
in his Tower room below.

“Aha,” thinks the sagacious young woman, “up yet,—the old Prowler, is he?
Well, we’ll see what we’ll do about it. I don’t want to hang around long
tonight!”

As may be gathered, Rosemary had overstayed her allowed time, and greatly
desired to get into the house and up to her room unnoticed. For Homer
Vincent was a bit strict about his niece’s behavior, and if truth be
told, his restrictions were rather necessary and all for Rosemary’s good.

Not that the girl was wilful or wayward, but at twenty-one, the hour of
midnight seems to strike very early in the evening, and usually just when
the fun is at its height. Yet it was a Medo-Persian law that Rosemary
should be in the house by twelve o’clock—and to give her just due, she
almost always was.

But tonight had been a gay and pleasant party, and she had been tempted
to remain beyond the hour.

The afternoon’s portent of snow had been fulfilled, and though the squall
had been short, it was severe, and now, though it was not snowing, there
was enough fallen snow and cold dampness to make any tarrying outside
exceedingly uncomfortable.

So Rosemary crept to the great window that was at the southern exposure
of the Tower room, and peeped in at her uncle.

Wrapped in her fur motor coat, a brown toque spilling its plumes down
one side of her pretty, eager face, Rosemary shivered as she picked her
way through the soft wet snow, but nodded in satisfaction as she saw her
uncle’s very evident absorption in whatever matter claimed his attention.

About to turn away, she paused a moment to notice him as he opened a
secret panel. She had known of the existence of this, but had never
before seen it opened.

Fascinated, she saw him searching among its contents, though she could
discern nothing definitely. The window had a thin film of curtain
material, and she really saw little beyond the moving silhouette and the
furniture of the room. Moreover, it suddenly came to her that she was
rudely spying upon another’s movements in a way she had no right to do,
and blushing to herself in the darkness, she turned quickly away.

Rosy from the icy air, her cheeks glowed; and curled up by the dampness,
her red-brown hair made little tendrils that blew across her face. She
snuggled into her fur collar and even welcomed the warmth of the long
russet plume that fell over one ear.

Carefully she slipped back again to the great front door, which she well
knew Hoskins had not yet locked for the night. Turning the knob slowly,
the opening door made no sound, and in a moment Rosemary was inside.

And it was just at that moment that Homer Vincent elected to return
to his bedroom. But the girl quickly stepped behind one of the great
columns, and stood in its protecting shadow while her uncle went up the
stairs.

She thought he limped a little more than usual, as he sometimes did when
tired, and a wave of regret swept through her tender heart that she had
disobeyed his orders.

“I’ll never do it again,” she resolved. “Uncle Homer is too good to me
for me to slight his wishes. I’m a wicked old thing!”

But a healthy, girlish hunger was more in evidence with her just
then than her feeling of conscience-stricken remorse, and she turned
her silent steps toward the dining-room. Here Mellish usually left
for her some tempting bit of food on a tray in a cold cupboard, and
investigating, Rosemary found a little mold of jellied chicken, with two
buttered finger-rolls and a plate of fruit.

Snapping on a small table light, she sat down to enjoy her little feast.

Hoskins, passing, looked in and smiled at her. It was not the first time
he had smiled at such a scene.

Soon Rosemary finished her lunch, and gathering up her fur coat, went
softly upstairs.

She paused at the door of her Aunt’s room. Sometimes, if Miss Anne were
awake, she liked to have Rosemary come in and tell her of the party. But
the sound of heavy asthmatic breathing proved Miss Anne asleep, and the
girl went on to her own rooms.

Her boudoir was the Tower room over the reception room and her bedroom
was next back of that. Everything was in readiness and it was but a short
time before Rosemary slumbered as soundly, if not as audibly, as her aunt.

Hoskins went his rounds stolidly. He was a good and faithful watchman,
largely because he had not the brains required for any higher calling.
His route he meticulously followed, punching his time clocks as required,
and throwing the flash of his electric lantern in dark corners.

His orders took him outside and around the house as well as through the
lower floors. The upper floors he was not required to patrol.

As usual, he found no disturbing element and trudged around his appointed
path like a patient ox. He had long since ceased to wonder at the beauty
and grandeur of Greatlarch,—to him it was merely the home of his employer.

He repeatedly tracked the soft wet snow in his journeys round the house,
removing his damp overshoes when making his inside rounds.

His shift ended at seven o’clock, and at that hour he gladly went into
the kitchen, where a hot breakfast awaited him.

“Nasty mess underfoot,” he confided to the maid who served him. “Don’t go
out today, my dear, lessen you have to.”

“The sun’s out bright,” she demurred, looking from the window.

“Yes, and that makes it all the wuss. Meltin’ an’ thawin’—sloppy weather,
my dear.”

As Hoskins’ “my dears” were matters of habit rather than real affection,
the girl paid but slight attention and went about her business.

The routine of breakfast preparations went on. The Mellishes appeared on
the stroke of seven-thirty, as was their wont. They gravely inspected the
work of their underlings and then set about their own superior duties.

All was in readiness at eight, though it was an entirely uncertain
question as to when the family would appear.

They were subject to moods or whims, sometimes having breakfast together
and again having trays carried to any rooms that pleased them.

Mellish opined, however, that this morning would see the family
congregated in the breakfast-room because of the presence of a guest.

And shortly after eight Homer Vincent appeared.

Though always impatient at a delay not of his own causing, he showed no
irritation and said to Mellish he would wait for Mr. Johnson to come down.

Then Rosemary appeared. Such a pretty Rosemary, her brown eyes smiling,
her animated little face showing a frank curiosity.

“Good morning,” she cried, “who’s here? Francine says there’s a guest.”

“Yes, but he isn’t down yet. A Mr. Johnson, who came to see Antan and
myself on some business affair.”

Rosemary had a funny little way of pronouncing Aunt Anne, and as it
sounded like Antan, the nickname had become habitual.

“Nice?” she asked, briefly.

“Rather,” her uncle returned. “Good business chap, fairly good-looking,
decent manners, but no particular charm.”

“Doesn’t sound much,” Rosemary observed; “may I begin my breakfast?”

“Oh, let’s wait a few moments. I told him eight o’clock, he’ll surely be
down in a few moments.”

And then Francine burst into the room, breathless and wild-eyed with
wonder.

“But what do you think?” she cried, quite forgetting her formalities.
“Miss Anne—I cannot rouse her and her door is bolted!”

Homer Vincent looked at her coldly.

“Remember your manners, Francine,” he said in a tone of reproach. “Your
information does not warrant such carelessness of address. Is Miss
Vincent still sleeping?”

“That’s just it, sir, I do not know. Always I hear her bell by eight
o’clock at latest. Now, I go and tap, but she answers not,—nor do I hear
her moving about inside her chamber.”

“Did you not go in?”

“But the door is locked,—bolted on the inside. Always she bolts it at
night, but the bolt is always off before this time in the day!”

Francine was a trim little figure, her plain black dress and white cap
and apron well becoming her. She was excitable, but this time her concern
was deeper than mere excited curiosity. Plainly, she was alarmed.

Vincent saw this, and spoke more kindly.

“Run up again, Francine, and rattle the door. I will go with you, if you
wish.”

“Oh, do, sir, I did rattle at the door, and there was no response. And I
did not hear her breathing—she—she breathes deeply, you know.”

This was a discreet allusion to Miss Anne’s asthma, which at times was
distinctly in evidence.

“Francine, I’m sure you’re needlessly excited; however, Mellish will go
up and see—”

The butler turned slowly toward the door, and Vincent said:

“No matter, Mellish, I’ll go myself,” and then, noting Rosemary’s
frightened glance, he added, “we’ll all go.”

He led the way to Miss Anne’s bedroom, the great south room on the
mezzanine above the hall.

The short flight of steps ended in a broad landing, the bedroom door in
its center. The door had been a heavy one of carved antique oak. But Miss
Anne had disliked it, saying it was like a prison door. So her brother
had had it removed and replaced by a light swing door, covered with
rose-colored velour and studded round its edges with brass-headed nails.

This door had a small bolt on the inside, but it was only to insure
privacy, not at all a protection from possible marauders.

Homer Vincent tapped at this door, calling “Anne—Anne, dear!”

There was no response and Vincent pressed his ear to the door.

The others watched, breathlessly, and Rosemary shrank back in nameless
dread while Francine fluttered and gave voice to voluble French
expletives.

“Be quiet, Francine!” Vincent commanded, and Mrs. Mellish, who had joined
the group, gave the French girl an admonitory shake.

“I shall break in the door,” Vincent said; “it’s a flimsy thing. Stand
back, Rosemary. Mellish, push here, as I strike.”

The combined strength of the two men easily forced the door, and Mellish
fell into the room first.

Vincent, following, hurried to his sister’s bed.

The beautiful room, built for the first mistress of the house, had a
raised dais, a sort of low platform for the bed to stand on. Also, from
the ceiling depended an elaborate cornice that surrounded the space
designed for the bed and from which hung voluminous curtains of silk
brocade.

In the shadowy gloom of these curtains lay Miss Anne, and as her brother
reached the bedside and pushed away the hangings to see his sister, he
cried out in a horrified voice, “Keep back! Mellish, keep back Miss
Rosemary!”

Waving a warning hand at them, Vincent leaned over the still form and
then turned round, his hands clenched and horror on his face.

“My sister is dead!” he cried. “She—she—oh, take that child away!”

“I will not be taken away, Uncle Homer,” Rosemary cried. “I’m not a baby!
Let me know the truth! What has happened?”

Breaking away from the restraining arms of Mrs. Mellish, unheeding
Mellish’s effort to stop her, she ran to the bedside and herself looked
inside the long curtains.

She saw a white, dead face, staring eyes and a nightdress stained with
crimson drops.




CHAPTER IV

A MYSTERIOUS DEATH


“Oh, Antan!” Rosemary cried, starting back in horror. “Oh, Uncle Homer,
what is it?”

Vincent put his arm round the terrified girl and they both gazed on the
dreadful sight. Both were white-faced and trembling, and though Homer
Vincent strove hard for composure, it was a few moments before he could
even speak.

Then, still holding Rosemary close, he spoke to the others.

“Mellish,” he said, “Miss Vincent is dead. She has been killed. That’s
all my brain can take in at present. I am stunned—I am heartbroken,”—and
the man’s enforced calm gave way as he sank into a chair and buried his
face in his hands.

Then Mrs. Mellish stepped nearer to the bed, gave one glance at the awful
sight and turned shuddering away.

“Leave the room,” she said to the trembling Francine. “You’ll be flying
into hysterics in a minute. I know you! Leave the room.”

“What shall I do? Where shall I go?” the French girl cried. “My place is
here—beside my mistress.”

“She’s right,” and Mellish showed surprised approval of Francine’s
self-control. “You stay in this room, Francine, and don’t you get to
blubbering. Keep your head, and you can be of good service. Mr. Vincent,
shall I call a doctor?”

“Why, yes,—do, Mellish. Poor Anne is dead, but—yes, I’d like you to call
Doctor McGee. And—and Mellish, I suppose we ought to notify—”

“Do nothing, sir, until Doctor McGee comes. He’ll know just what to do.”

Mellish departed to telephone the Doctor, and Homer Vincent, lifting his
bowed head, rose and began to assume his usual place at the helm.

“I can’t seem to think,” he said, as he brushed his hand across his brow.
“Rosemary, who could have done such a thing? Who could harm such a dear
lady?”

“Oh, I don’t know, Uncle,—did—did somebody kill her?”

“Unless she took her own life—she wouldn’t do that, would she, Rosemary?”

It was strange the way the strong and self sufficient man seemed to
appeal to his niece. Mrs. Mellish regarded him solicitously. She had
never before seen Homer Vincent troubled.

“There now, sir,” she said, in kindly fashion, “you can do nothing for
the poor lady now. Come down to the breakfast-room, sir, and take a cup
of coffee and a bite of breakfast. Come now, Miss Rosemary, let Melly fix
you out.”

The girl often called Mrs. Mellish thus, to distinguish her from her
husband.

“Oh,” exclaimed Vincent, suddenly, “that man, that Mr. Johnson! He must
be already down in the breakfast-room, and no one to look after him! Run
down to him, Melly.”

“Come you, too, sir. And Miss Rosemary. The man must be told,—best you
should do it, Mr. Vincent.”

“Yes,” and Homer Vincent rose, with a determination to do his part,
however hard it might be. “Rosemary, will you come with me, or will you
have your breakfast taken to your rooms?”

“I’ll go with you, Uncle. Perhaps I can help. Who is Mr. Johnson?”

“He’s a man who came yesterday on business, and I asked him to stay the
night. I asked him to stay on, but I hope he’ll go this morning.”

“Oh, he surely will,—when he hears—Uncle Homer, I can’t believe it!” she
looked again at the silent, pitiful figure on the bed, where Francine was
lightly laying a fine handkerchief over the face of poor Anne Vincent.

“That’s all right,” Vincent said, slowly, “but don’t touch the body
otherwise, Francine. It—it isn’t right to do so.”

“No, sir,” and the maid nodded, comprehendingly.

“Come now, sir,” Mrs. Mellish urged him, and with a backward glance of
grief and bewilderment, Vincent followed Rosemary from the room.
